# Life Insurance Lapse Analysis and Prediction

## üåç Why This Project Matter

In life insurance, **persistency is one of the most critical health indicators** of a portfolio.  
High lapse rates create operational inefficiencies, erode customer trust, and complicate long-term financial planning.  

Yet, insurers often struggle to answer two essential questions:
1. **What are the key drivers behind policy lapses?** ‚Äì Are lapses driven more by payment methods, distribution channels, customer demographics, or product design?  
2. **Which customers are most at risk of lapsing?** ‚Äì Can we anticipate lapse behavior early enough to intervene?

This project addresses both questions by combining **advanced analytics techniques** with **deep domain knowledge in life insurance**, offering a structured way to uncover hidden patterns and build predictive risk models that are interpretable and actionable.

### Dataset Discription

The dataset contains **100,000 policy records** from an anonymized life insurance portfolio.  
It includes information on **policies, customers (life assured), agents, distribution channels, and policy status**.  
These features form the foundation for analyzing **drivers of policy lapse** and building **predictive models** to estimate lapse risk.  

- **Number of Rows**: 100,000  
- **Number of Columns**: 38  
- **Target Variable**: `lapse_inforce` (1 = Lapse, 0 = Inforce)

**Insight**: Auto-debit, sourcing channel, and payment method dominate risk factors.  

### ROC Curve (Model Comparison)
![ROC Curve](images/roc_curves.png)  
**Insight**: HGB clearly dominates in distinguishing lapse vs. inforce.  

### Precision‚ÄìRecall Curve (Best Model: HGB)
![PR Curve](images/pr_curve.png)  
**Insight**: At threshold ~0.5, Precision=0.86, Recall=0.88. Business can tune threshold:  
- Lower threshold ‚Üí higher recall, catch more lapse risk.  
- Higher threshold ‚Üí higher precision, fewer false alarms.  

### Confusion Matrix (HGB ‚Äì Threshold=0.5)
![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion_matrix.png)  
**Insight**:  
- True Lapse caught: **13.5k** (88%).  
- False Alarms: ~2.2k inforce contracts flagged incorrectly.

## üöÄ Business Implications
- **Auto Debit**: Policies without auto-debit ‚Üí **95% more likely to lapse**.  
- **Digital/Online channels**: Higher lapse ‚Üí need stronger onboarding & follow-up.  
- **Socio-demographic factors**: Income, education, city tier strongly linked to persistency.  
- **Agent Experience**: Inexperienced agents‚Äô policies show higher lapse ‚Üí need coaching.  

**Retention Strategy**:  
- **High Risk (p ‚â• 0.70)**: intensive outreach, auto-debit enrollment.  
- **Medium Risk (0.50‚Äì0.70)**: early reminders, tailored communication.  
- **Low Risk (<0.50)**: standard retention campaign.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Next Steps
- Data from one insurer; may not generalize across markets.  
- External macroeconomic effects (COVID, recession) not included.  
- Next steps:  
  - Deploy scoring into CRM system.  
  - Monitor model drift quarterly.  
  - Add external features (macro factors, competitor data).

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting  

---

## üìå Takeaway
This project demonstrates that **data-driven lapse prediction is actionable**:  
- It uncovers *why* policies lapse.  
- It predicts *who* is at risk.  
- It empowers insurers to act *before* customers lapse.  

üëâ **Outcome**: boost persistency, reduce acquisition costs, and strengthen long-term customer trust.  

## ‚ö° Executive Summary
- **Top Drivers**: Auto-debit status, sourcing channel (Online), first payment method, customer profile (income, education, city tier), premium size.  
- **Best Model**: HistGradientBoosting ‚Äî ROC AUC **0.84**, Recall (lapse) **0.88**.  
- **Key Finding**: Policies without auto-debit are at **95% higher lapse risk**.  
- **Business Action**: Target High-Risk customers with proactive outreach & auto-debit promotion.  
- **Impact**: Improve persistency ‚Üí +5% retention = up to **+25% profit uplift**.
