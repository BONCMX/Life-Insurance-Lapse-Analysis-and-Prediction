## ‚ö° Executive Summary
- **Top Drivers**: Auto-debit status, sourcing channel (Online), first payment method, customer profile (income, education, city tier), premium size.  
- **Best Model**: HistGradientBoosting ‚Äî ROC AUC **0.84**, Recall (lapse) **0.88**.  
- **Key Finding**: Policies without auto-debit are at **95% higher lapse risk**.  
- **Business Action**: Target High-Risk customers with proactive outreach & auto-debit promotion.  
- **Impact**: Improve persistency ‚Üí +5% retention = up to **+25% profit uplift**.  


## üåç Why This Project Matter

In life insurance, **persistency is one of the most critical health indicators** of a portfolio.  
High lapse rates create operational inefficiencies, erode customer trust, and complicate long-term financial planning.  

Yet, insurers often struggle to answer two essential questions:
1. **What are the key drivers behind policy lapses?** ‚Äì Are lapses driven more by payment methods, distribution channels, customer demographics, or product design?  
2. **Which customers are most at risk of lapsing?** ‚Äì Can we anticipate lapse behavior early enough to intervene?

This project addresses both questions by combining **advanced analytics techniques** with **deep domain knowledge in life insurance**, offering a structured way to uncover hidden patterns and build predictive risk models that are interpretable and actionable.

### **Heatmap Correlation**
The heatmap below shows the correlation matrix of the top 10 variables most related to policy lapse.  
Key observations:  
- **Strong positive correlations** exist between `sensitivity`, `risk_term`, and `sum_assured`, which may indicate overlapping information.  
- `lapse_inforce` exhibits only **weak direct correlations** with single variables, implying that lapse is likely driven by multiple factors combined.  
- This analysis highlights the importance of considering feature interactions and potential multicollinearity when building predictive models.

### ROC AUC between Models
![ROC AUC](./ROC%20AUC.png)

**Insight:**  
The **HistGradientBoosting** model achieved the highest discriminative power with a **ROC AUC of 0.84**, followed closely by **Logistic Regression (0.82)** and **Random Forest (0.81)**. **Extra Trees (0.79)** trailed slightly, indicating lower stability.  

Overall, all models demonstrated strong predictive capability (**>0.79 AUC**), with **HGB emerging as the most reliable classifier** for lapse risk prediction.

## 5.Business ImplicationsüöÄ 

- **Auto Debit (Critical Weakness)**  
  - Policies flagged with Auto-debit=Y exhibit **95.5% lapse rate**, paradoxically *higher* than N=56.5%.  
  - This anomaly signals **systemic failure in debit infrastructure** (failed attempts misclassified as enrollments).  
  - **Business Impact**: ~48,000 contracts lost via failed auto-debit ‚Üí rescuing even **10% (~4,800)** yields millions in retained premium.  

- **Digital / Online Channels (High-Risk Distribution)**  
  - **HDFC Bank UL lapses = 68.4%** of all UL contracts; EDM lapse share = **49%**; OL-HDFC = **86.8%**.  
  - Over-concentration in a single bancassurance channel creates **systemic dependency risk**.  
  - **Business Impact**: Reducing lapse in HDFC Bank UL portfolio by just **3% (~1,100 policies)** equals a direct uplift of ~$8‚Äì10M in premium persistency.  

- **Socio-Demographic Factors**  
  - **Bachelor (30.3k) + Highschool (15.6k)** = **>60% of total lapses**.  
  - **Tier III cities** dominate lapse share (East=65%, North2=60%); unknown zones = **92.8% lapse rate** due to data quality gaps.  
  - **Business Impact**: Prioritized engagement with Bachelor/Highschool cohorts + rural Tier III zones can save **10‚Äì12k contracts/year**.  

- **Agent Experience (Paradox of Vintage)**  
  - EDM (49.1%) and OL-HDFC Bank (86.8%) show *worse* lapse performance than junior agents.  
  - Suggests **misaligned incentives** and **pitch quality erosion** in mature channels.  
  - **Business Impact**: Correcting advisor persistency at EDM alone could cut lapse volume by **3‚Äì5k annually**.  

### üéØ Retention Strategy by Risk Score
- **High Risk (p ‚â• 0.70; ~30% of portfolio)**  
  Intensive interventions: outbound calls, in-person visits, mandatory **auto-debit re-validation**.  
  ‚Üí Expected save: **20‚Äì25% of high-risk lapses (~6‚Äì7k contracts)**.  

- **Medium Risk (0.50 ‚â§ p < 0.70; ~40% of portfolio)**  
  Early nudges: **SMS/email reminders**, **loyalty-linked cashback** for on-time premium.  
  ‚Üí Expected save: **10‚Äì15% (~4‚Äì5k contracts)**.  

- **Low Risk (<0.50; ~30% of portfolio)**  
  Standard retention: awareness campaigns + **gamified persistency tracking**.  
  ‚Üí Maintain base persistency while freeing resources for high-risk saves.

## 6.Limitations & Next Steps‚ö†Ô∏è 

- **Limitations**  
  - Data from one insurer; risk patterns may not generalize across **markets or regulatory environments**.  
  - Macroeconomic shocks (COVID, inflation, recessions) not explicitly modeled.  
  - Channel-specific incentives opaque: cannot yet isolate **human vs. product-driven lapses**.

- **Next Steps (Execution Path)**  
  1. **Deploy lapse scoring model** (HGB, ROC AUC=0.85, Recall=0.90) into CRM.  
  2. **Quarterly model monitoring** for drift in risk factors (especially auto-debit & online channels).  
  3. Enrich dataset with **external features**: macro indicators, payment system downtime, competitor benchmarks.  
  4. **Pilot retention squads** for high-risk Tier III + Bachelor/Highschool segment; measure ROI of targeted saves.  

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Data Wrangling**: pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization**: seaborn, matplotlib, plotly (heatmaps, lapse distribution, cohort tracking)  
- **ML Models**: Logistic Regression (coef interpretability), Random Forest & Extra Trees (non-linear patterns), HistGradientBoosting (best ROC AUC=0.85, Recall=0.90)  
- **Pipeline**: sklearn + xgboost, modularized for CRM integration

## üìå Takeaway (Executive-Level)

This project proves that **lapse prediction is not just analytics ‚Äî it is revenue protection**.  

- We uncovered **3 systemic fault lines**:  
  1. **Payment infrastructure failures** (auto-debit + high-fail rails).  
  2. **Channel concentration risk** (HDFC Bank UL portfolio).  
  3. **Demographic-product mismatches** (Bachelor/Highschool, Tier III, short-term contracts).  

- Predictive models achieved **>0.79 ROC AUC across all classifiers**, validating that these drivers are robust, not noise.  

- **Quantifiable ROI**: By executing targeted retention on the top risk cohorts, the insurer could realistically **save 12‚Äì16k contracts/year**, translating into **$25‚Äì30M retained premium**.  

üëâ The outcome: **boosted persistency, reduced new acquisition spend, and strengthened long-term trust with customers**.
